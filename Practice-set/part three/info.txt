Create a list of technologies-> Html, Css, JavaScript, Node js, React js, Sql, MongoDb, Java, C++, C & Python
Now change the display to inline of all list items to move them in a single line
(Our bulletpoints will disappear).
coz-> Li(list items) have their display property set to "list-item" by default which makes them a bulleted
list item, when this property is reset to "inline", then the bullet points also disappear. In a way we override
the default settings with our css.
